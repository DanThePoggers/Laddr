# 🛡️ Security Policy

At **AgnetLabs**, we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of security across all our open-source projects.

If you discover a security vulnerability in any repository under the **AgnetLabs** organization, please follow the process below.

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've found a security issue or vulnerability, **do not** open a public GitHub issue.  
Instead, please contact our security team directly at:

📧 **info@agnetlabs.com**

We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours** and work closely with you to verify, reproduce, and resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

## 🔒 Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

To ensure a responsible and coordinated resolution:

1. Do **not** publicly disclose details of the vulnerability before a fix is released.
2. Provide as much detail as possible — steps to reproduce, potential impact, and affected components.
3. Avoid any testing that could compromise data, user privacy, or service integrity.
4. Once a fix is deployed, we may publicly thank you for your responsible disclosure (if you wish).

## 🧩 Scope

This policy applies to all public repositories under the [AgnetLabs GitHub organization](https://github.com/AgnetLabs), including experimental, community, and production-grade projects.

## 💙 Thank You
