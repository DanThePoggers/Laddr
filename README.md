# 🛠️ Laddr - Build Powerful Multi-Agent Systems Easily

## 🚀 Getting Started

Laddr is a Python framework that helps you create systems where multiple agents can work together. These agents can communicate, delegate tasks, and run different jobs at the same time. Imagine a small team of AI agents working like a well-coordinated group, making your applications smarter and faster. 

With Laddr, you can build systems that work better together without getting bogged down by complexity.
